<p>Preventive care is a vital aspect of maintaining good health and well-being. It involves taking proactive measures to
	prevent illness, detect potential health issues early, and promote overall wellness. This approach to healthcare not
	only helps individuals lead healthier lives but also reduces the burden on the healthcare system by minimizing the
	need for costly treatments and hospitalizations.</p>

<h2>Why Is Preventive Care Important?</h2>
<p>There are several key reasons why preventive care is essential:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Early Detection:</strong> Regular check-ups and screenings can identify health problems at an early stage
		when they are often more treatable and less severe.</li>
	<li><strong>Disease Prevention:</strong> Many diseases and conditions can be prevented or managed through lifestyle
		modifications, vaccinations, and screenings.</li>
	<li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Preventive care is typically less expensive than treating advanced illnesses and
		can save individuals and healthcare systems significant money.</li>
	<li><strong>Improved Quality of Life:</strong> Staying proactive about your health can lead to a higher quality of
		life, increased longevity, and greater overall well-being.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Components of Preventive Care</h2>
<p>Preventive care encompasses various aspects of healthcare, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Regular Check-Ups:</strong> Visit your healthcare provider for routine check-ups to monitor your health
		and catch potential issues early.</li>
	<li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Stay up-to-date on recommended vaccinations to protect yourself and others from
		preventable diseases.</li>
